How do I use the batch search tool?,"The batch search tool allows you to:
Upload taxonomic composition data (Kraken, MetaPhlAn, or Krona formats)
Select your file format from the dropdown menu
Specify host information (insect order and species name)
Get potential symbiont matches with scoring
After clicking ""Search Symbionts,"" you'll see a table of results showing potential symbionts, their functions, abundance percentages, and match scores. You can download the complete results for further analysis."
What principles does the Batch Search Tool use to find potential symbionts?,"The Batch Search Tool identifies potential symbionts by:
Comparing your taxonomic data against our insect symbiont database
Scoring matches based on multiple factors:
Abundance percentage in your sample
Taxonomic match level (species matches score higher than genus-only matches)
Host insect match (same order +10 points, same species +20 points)
Richness of functional description (more detailed descriptions score higher)
The system then ranks potential symbionts by total score, helping you identify the most likely symbiotic relationships in your data."
What file formats does the Batch Search Tool accept?,"The Batch Search Tool accepts three file formats:
Kraken2 reports (tab-separated with percentage and taxonomic info)
MetaPhlAn output (taxonomy strings with abundance values)
Krona input format (tab-separated with counts and full taxonomy path)
You can either upload your file directly or paste the content into the text area."
How are the search results scored and ranked?,"Results are scored based on:
Base score = abundance percentage in your sample
Species-level match: +5 points
Host order match: +10 points
Host species match: +20 points
Function description: up to +5 points (based on detail level)
Higher scores indicate more likely symbiotic relationships. Results are ranked by total score, with a maximum of 3 entries per symbiont."
Can I filter or search within my batch search results?,"Yes, you can:
Use the search box above the results table to filter by any text
Sort results by clicking on column headers
View detailed information by clicking on symbiont IDs
Download complete results as a text file for further analysis
This makes it easy to focus on specific symbionts or patterns in your data."
Where do the functional descriptions and classifications in the symbiont records in the database come from?,"All symbiont records in our database come exclusively from peer-reviewed scientific literature. The functional descriptions are taken directly from the original publications, ensuring accuracy and fidelity to the source. Additionally, our classification criteria are based on a comprehensive review of all collected functional records combined with insights from relevant past reviews."

How is the gene catalog constructed?,"The gene catalog was built from predicted genes in the genomes using the following steps:

Gene Prediction:

Prodigal was used to predict genes:
Metagenomic contigs processed in metagenomic mode (-p meta).
Single genomes processed in single-genome mode (-p single).
Nonredundant Gene Clustering:

CD-HIT was used to remove redundant genes, grouping sequences with:
≥90% identity
≥90% coverage
This resulted in a nonredundant gene catalog for each host species.
Functional Annotation:

DIAMOND aligned genes to the NR (non-redundant protein) database to determine functions.
eggNOG-mapper assigned:
COG functional categories
KEGG pathways using eggNOG DB 5.0.2."
How is the genome catalog constructed?,"The genome catalog consists of 3,520 newly recovered MAGs (Metagenome-Assembled Genomes) and 2,078 published insect symbiont genomes from sources like NCBI, NGDC, and BV-BRC. These genomes were processed as follows:

Quality Assessment:

Each genome was evaluated using CheckM.
The MIMAG standard was applied, with genomes removed if they had:
Completeness <50%
Contamination >10%
Quality score (QS) <50 (QS = completeness - 5 × contamination).
Taxonomic Annotation:

GTDB-Tk was used for classification under default parameters (dataset r220).
Additional taxonomic and functional information from literature was incorporated."
